# This is as Recepi Application

  This application was created to improve my React knowledge, using Vite.

<h3>
  What I have learned?
</h3>
- Vite is a better way than create-react-app to start a new React application because its bundler and compiler have greater performance, than webpack and babel, and it implements CSS Modules by default that is really useful to deal with CSS Scope.
